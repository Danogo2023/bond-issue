## Smart Contract Interactions

![smart-contract-interactions](./00.overview.drawio.svg)

As the diagram above, users (Borrower/Lender) will interact with two types of entities (**Borrow Request** and **Bond**). Borrower creates borrow requests, and then lenders fulfills the borrow requests. The fulfilling transactions introduce bonds and send bond tokens as certificate to lender to redeem bond later.  

## Tokens

- **Borrower NFT**: Non-fungible token to represent ownership of a borrow request
- **Borrow Request NFT**: Non-fungible token to authenticate a borrow request state
- **Bond NFT**: Non-fungible token to authenticate a bond state
- **Bond Tokens**: Fungible tokens act like certificates to redeem specified bond

## UTxOs

- **Borrow Request UTxO**: reflects the state of a borrow request. Locking prepaid interest
- **Bond UTxO**: reflects the state of a bond. Locking bond principal and interest
