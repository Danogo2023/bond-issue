# Borrow Request::Create

## UTxO Diagram

![utxo-diagram](./01.borrow-request-create.svg)

## Explanations

### Inputs

- Borrower UTxO

### Outputs

- Borrow Request UTxO: Hold state of borrow request authenticated by Borrow Request NFT
- Borrower UTxO: Hold ownership token (Borrower NFT) of the borrow request

### Redeemers

- RequestCreate

```aiken
RequestCreate {
    # output reference of a spending input (in this transaction) to generate nft name
    out_ref: OutputReference,
    # payment script hash of borrow request
    req_skh: ScriptKeyHash,
    # policy id of minting tokens
    pid: PolicyId,
  }
```

### Notes

- Both of Borrower NFT and Borrow Request NFT are unique on protocol. In order to achieve the uniqueness, a reference of spending input will be specified as seed to generate the nft name. Since the out ref is unique, the generated name is also unique: $$ nft\_name = blake2b\_256(output\_reference)$$
